The bias vector is the weights vector multiplied by $-B$, where $B$ is also a hyperparameter. Recall that the $A$ term punishes the selection of nodes that are connected by an edge, and the $B$ term maximizes the total weight among selected nodes. In general, the hyperparameters should be set with $A > B$ to increase the likelihood of generating a set that is independent."
