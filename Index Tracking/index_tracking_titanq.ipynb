    "# TitanQ Index Tracking Example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The index tracking problem in finance refers to the challenge of creating and managing a portfolio that closely replicates the performance of a specific stock market index, such as the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, while minimizing tracking error and associated costs. This problem is central to passive investment strategies, such as index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which aim to deliver the same returns as the index they track.\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyze the Index Tracking problem as a non-linear quadratically constrained, quadratic optimization problem (MIQCP). This problem is challenging due to the non-linearity and the constraints, making it computationally intensive and difficult to solve directly especially when taking into account real world constraints and a large number of possible assets.
